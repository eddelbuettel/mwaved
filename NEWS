mwaved 1.0.0
============

* Added `which` argument to plot.mWaveD method to specify certain plots to be output.

mwaved 0.9.0 (development)
============

* Added ggplot2 support as a suggested package (also included a suggestion of gridExtra to help facilitate multiple ggplot outputs on same window)
* Added interactive Shiny applet to showcase the method, can run by calling mWaveDDemo() at R prompt

mwaved 0.2.0 (development)
============

* Standardised the mWaveD object to contain wavelet coefficients for the empirical and hard-shrinked coefficients both in the format of `waveletCoef` objects. Standardises the plotting of such coefficients using the `plot.waveletCoef` method.
* Defensively programmed input arguments to avoid infeasible input being processed (throws warnings or errors)

mwaved 0.1.1 (development)
============

* Proof read and updated documentation and added references.

mwaved 0.1 (development)
===========

* new set of functions included with a `multi` prefix that handle Multichannel deconvolution using the WaveD paradigm.
* plot and summary methods for the `mWaveD` objects created by the `multiWaveD` function.
* Added a `waveletCoef` object with a `plot` method to help ease plotting of wavelet coefficients.
* included simulation functions using a `make` prefix (including LIDAR, Doppler, Blocks, Bumps and Cusp).
* included `gammaBlur` and `blurSignal` functions to help ease simulation.
